# nit

> Point-and-click website annotation that hands small UI fixes straight to a coding agent.

You're browsing your product and spot the little things — a badge in the wrong color, an unfilled
star icon, a dead active-state. Filing tickets for those is overkill; describing them to an AI agent
in prose is lossy ("the third tile… no, on the landing page…").

**nit** is the missing input device: click the element, type the nit, done. Every annotation is
recorded with a stable reference to the element (component tag, Angular class name when available,
verified-unique CSS selector, XPath, screenshot), the route, and the viewport — precise enough for a
coding agent to find the source and fix it without any further context.

The name is from code-review culture: reviewers prefix minor comments with `nit:`.

## The loop

```
┌────────────┐      ┌───────────────────┐      ┌────────────┐
│ nit review │ ───► │ your coding agent │ ───► │ nit verify │ ─── reopened? ──┐
│  annotate  │      │  fixes each open  │      │  before /  │                 │
│  the site  │      │  change-request   │      │   after    │ ◄───────────────┘
└────────────┘      └───────────────────┘      └────────────┘
```

1. `nit review https://staging.example.com` — a real Chromium opens with an annotation overlay
   and a devtools-style panel window beside it. Alt-click elements, describe changes, save.
2. Hand the produced `nit-review/` folder to a coding agent (Claude Code, etc.) — or serve it as
   an MCP server with `nit mcp`. The agent fixes each open change request and marks it `fixed`.
3. `nit verify nit-review/annotations.json` — nit reopens the site, captures **after** screenshots
   next to the originals, and you rule each fix **Verified** or **Reopen**. Reopened items become
   actionable again for the next agent round.

Teammates run the same tool, `nit export` their review as a zip, and after `nit import` a
`nit merge` folds everything into one consolidated review with per-author attribution.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @spaceparrots/nit
nit doctor        # checks Node ≥ 18 + dependencies, offers to install Chromium (one-time)
nit setup         # per project: review dir + .gitignore + MCP server (interactive wizard)
```

Or without installing: `npx @spaceparrots/nit review https://example.com`

## Commands

| Command | Alias | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nit setup` | `init` | One-time project setup: review dir, .gitignore, MCP (wizard) |
| `nit review <url>` | `r`, `annotate` | Open a browser and annotate a site |
| `nit view <file>` | `v`, `replay` | Replay a feedback file — pins re-anchored on their routes |
| `nit verify <file>` | `check` | Capture after-shots for fixed items, rule Verified / Reopen |
| `nit export [dir]` | `pack` | Pack a review into a shareable zip |
| `nit import <zip>` | `unpack` | Unpack a co-founder's review zip |
| `nit merge <file...>` | `combine` | Combine feedback files into one consolidated review |
| `nit mcp [dir]` | `serve` | Serve a review folder as an MCP server (stdio) |
| `nit mcp-install [dir]` | `mcp-config` | Register the MCP server in this project's .mcp.json |
| `nit doctor` | — | Check the environment, install Chromium if missing |

Sharing a review between people:

```bash
nit export                        # → 2026-07-21-example.com-ann.nit.zip (id + author)
nit import 2026-07-21-example.com-ann.nit.zip
nit merge nit-review/annotations.json 2026-07-21-example.com-ann/annotations.json
```

Every command has detailed help: `nit <command> --help`. Common flags: `--mobile` (start in a
390×844 viewport), `--headless`, `--out <dir>`, `--author <name>`.

### Reviewing

- **Alt** (or the chip bottom-left) toggles element picking; hover highlights with the component
  tag; **click** selects; **Esc** cancels.
- The popover records the comment, a **type** — *change request* (actionable) or *comment*
  (context) — and a **viewport scope** (this viewport / general).
- The **panel window** next to the browser lists everything, switches desktop ↔ mobile, filters by
  scope, deletes items and finishes the review — nothing overlays the page under review.
- Works on CSP-hardened production sites, plain static pages, and SPAs (annotations are pinned to
  client-side routes).

## What you get

```
nit-review/
├─ annotations.json     # structured, agent-readable (schema below)
├─ review.md            # human-readable, screenshots embedded, ACTIONABLE markers
├─ fix-annotations.md   # the contract for the fixing agent
└─ shots/*.png          # cropped element screenshots (+ after-shots from nit verify)
```

One annotation:

```json
{
  "id": "a1",
  "type": "change-request",
  "comment": "Star icons are not filled — they read as 0/5 ratings.",
  "status": "open",
  "author": "Kevin",
  "viewportScope": "desktop",
  "viewport": { "mode": "desktop", "w": 1440, "h": 900 },
  "route": "/auth/sign-in",
  "target": {
    "component": "app-testimonial-card",
    "ngComponent": null,
    "selector": "app-auth-shell aside app-testimonial-card span:nth-of-type(3)",
    "xpath": "/html[1]/body[1]/app-root[1]/…/span[3]",
    "tag": "span",
    "classes": ["inline-flex", "items-center", "text-accent-400"],
    "text": "",
    "rect": { "x": 209, "y": 613, "w": 280, "h": 12 }
  },
  "screenshot": "shots/a1.png",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-21T02:28:11.550Z"
}
```

The full schema is documented in [`src/types.ts`](./src/types.ts). Statuses flow
`open → fixed → verified | reopened` (plus `wontfix`), and `reopened` change-requests are
actionable again.

## Agent handoff

Point your agent at the folder — `fix-annotations.md` contains the contract: *fix every
`change-request` with status `open` or `reopened` at the referenced element, then set its status to
`fixed`; treat `comment`s as context.*

Or let the agent work through MCP tools instead of raw files:

```bash
nit mcp-install                  # writes the server into this project's .mcp.json
                                 # (created or merged; OS-aware — uses cmd /c on Windows)
claude mcp add nit -- nit mcp ./nit-review   # alternative: user-scoped via the Claude CLI
```

Tools: `list_annotations` (filterable, reports the actionable count) · `get_annotation` (full
record — screenshots are returned as images) · `mark_fixed` · `set_status`.

## Angular?

nit is framework-agnostic, with one bonus for Angular apps: on dev/staging builds that expose
`window.ng`, each annotation also records the component **class name** (`ProductTileComponent`) —
the single best pointer for a fixing agent. On production builds the custom-element tag
(`app-product-tile`) is captured instead; both are enough to locate the source.

## How it works

One Playwright-launched Chromium (persistent profile, `bypassCSP: true`), one vanilla-JS overlay
injected via `addInitScript` into an isolated Shadow DOM — it runs on any site without touching it
and serves capture, replay and verify alike. The overlay talks to Node through `exposeBinding`;
screenshots are CDP element-clips; replay re-anchors elements selector → XPath → text heuristic and
degrades to a "couldn't place" list instead of breaking. Zero backend, zero changes to the site
under review; output is plain files.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build   # compile TypeScript (src/ -> dist/)
node dist/cli/index.js doctor
npm test        # builds first, then unit tables (target/anchor/store/render/merge) + headless browser integration
npm run lint
```

## License

nit is licensed under the [GNU AGPL-3.0](./LICENSE). It's free to use, modify and self-host, but the
copyleft terms mean any distributed or **network-hosted** modified version must make its source
available under the same license — so nobody can take nit closed-source and resell it.

Need to use nit in a way AGPL-3.0 doesn't allow (e.g. embedding it in a closed-source or commercial
product)? A separate commercial license is available — reach out to
